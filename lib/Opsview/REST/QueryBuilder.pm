=head1 NAME

Opsview::REST::QueryBuilder - Role to transform attributes into a valid method URL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Moo;
    
    has base => ( default => '/downtime' );

    with 'Opsview::REST::QueryBuilder'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role to help adding functionalities to the Opsview::REST. It only
requires the consumer to have a "base", and it will generate a valid method
URL when the consumer object is instantiated.

It offers the "as_string" method, which is handled by L<URI>.
